# Comparison of XAI Methods

## Group Project in XAI exercise

### Task
- Many XAI methods have been discussed in the lecture so far. Which one is most appropriate to apply to a specific dataset?
- Task: Compare several XAI methods of your choice on the same dataset and analyze the comparison.
- Guiding questions:
  - Which XAI methods are applicable or make sense to apply for this task and model? Why?
  - How can they be evaluated? Which method performs better?
  - Based on the results, are there any observations that could lead to potential model improvements?

### Dataset
- Resource (datasets with human annotations):
  - Image dataset:
    - https://github.com/holyseven/M4_XAI_Benchmark (1 text, 1 image)
    - https://xaidataset.github.io/dataset/ (8 image data)
  - Text dataset:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data (1 text)
    - https://github.com/acmi-lab/counterfactually-augmented-data (2 text)
    - https://github.com/holyseven/M4_XAI_Benchmark (1 text, 1 image)
  - Optional (contact us):
    - Proposing your own projects/dataset
    - Demo/Late-breaking work paper.

### How to work
- Form a group of 2 members. 
- Choose 2 datasets and 3 XAI methods.
- Steps:
  1. Find a pretrained model or train a model for each dataset.
  2. Apply selected XAI methods to these models for the chosen datasets.
  3. Evaluate the XAI methods and analyze the results.

### Presentation
- Task is done in groups, all group members get the same number of points (unless you talk to us because there are problems..)
- Practical assignment will be graded based on a 3-minute project presentation in the exercises sessions on 13.01 and 20.01.2025. Attendance in the session assigned to you is mandatory to pass. No exceptions.
